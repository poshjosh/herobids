## 2026-10-25: authoring and verification

- **Authored** this entrypoint set, replacing the queue and rules in AGENT-ENTRYPOINT.md (now a pointer).
- **Verified P3.1 and P3.2 in code.** Route: `apps/api/src/routes/agent-interactivity.ts` (`POST` and `GET /messaging/chat/:provider/webhook`). Bypass: `apps/api/src/plugins/auth.ts`, pattern `^/messaging/chat/[a-z0-9-]+/webhook$`. Status set to done (DEC-14).
- **Verified the Telegram constant-time secret check.** `apps/api/src/routes/telegram-channel.ts` uses `timingSafeEqual`. `apps/api/src/routes/telegram-channel.test.ts`: 15 of 15 passed. Bug report 001 filed (FIXED). Defect origin `919f9ec7`, fix `d553c64e`.
- **Reviewed other secret and signature checks.** Stripe and Creem use a length-checked `timingSafeEqual`. No change needed.
- **Recorded** that W and E are implemented (W1 to W8, E1 to E7) with manual checks still open (W9, E8). Recorded in the 900 "W and E implementation status" section.
- **Found** that CH2W (002 two-way chat) is a draft with no code. A2A-B depends on it. Added as a blocked item.



## 2026-10-25: owner records W9 and E8 manual checks

- **W9 (M1 to M5)** and **E8 (M-E1 to M-E4)** were run by the owner on 2026-10-24 and reported passed. Recorded in [user-acceptance-tests §19](../../../../../tech/user-acceptance-tests.md). W and E are ticked in QUEUE.md (DEC-29).
- **Open:** M-E5 (SES bounce and complaint metrics after the first run). Owner.
- **Open:** EM-02 (email cap) and EM-03 (toggle default) are in the UAT file and not recorded.
- The agent did not re-run these checks.

Next ready item: C0.

## 2026-10-25: owner decisions recorded

- Recorded D01 to D09 as DEC-30 to DEC-39 in DECISIONS.md. The open list is closed.
- Queue rewritten: C2-R (independent review) and E-R1 (email rule) added. The two-way chat item (CH2W) now runs after C1.
- C1 spec: clarified that `agent_outbound_messages` keeps its delivery columns.
- C2 spec: `POST /agents/verify-telegram` is removed (DEC-34). No web caller exists. Confirmed by search.
- Plan 002: status updated and section 9 answers recorded (section 11).

Next ready item: C0.

## 2026-10-25: MVP scope change for agent-to-agent (DEC-40 to DEC-46)

- Owner decisions recorded in DECISIONS.md: same-user agents may message by default; the trading-tool risk is accepted for the MVP (DEC-41); one per-user rate limit of 10 per minute (DEC-42); owner view and a per-user stop switch (DEC-43); prompt-injection stance deferred (DEC-44).
- Deferred with specs kept: C2, C2-R, E-R1, U, the grant table and screen, A2A-C, A2A-D (DEC-45).
- A2A-A reduced to the same-user check. Its old grant spec file was removed and replaced by `A2A-A-same-user-check.md`.
- A2A-B rewritten as the MVP send path.
- Queue order: C0, C1, CH2W, A2A-A, A2A-B (DEC-46).
- Known gap accepted: chat address claims are unverified until C2 ships. Recorded for the owner.
- No code changed. No tests run.

Next ready item: C0.

## 2026-10-25: C0 baseline

- **Files changed (docs only, no code):** `900-implementation-plan.md` (new "C0 baseline record (2026-10-25)" section), `095-chat-address-migration-plan.md` (§6 conflicting figures replaced with a pointer to 900), `QUEUE.md` (C0 ticked), `PROGRESS.md`.
- **Tree:** `git status` clean at start (HEAD `f0f5c2ad`). No install needed (dependencies present, no manifest change).
- **`pnpm test`:** completed, exit 1. 413 files: 1 failed, 376 passed, 36 skipped. 7457 tests: 2 failed, 6991 passed, 464 skipped. Duration about 31 s.
- **Failures:** both in `packages/domain/src/config/schema.test.ts` (`AppConfigSchema — agentCreation`, "defaults the agent-creation limits to 10 / 10 / 6 when the block is absent" and "accepts zero and positive operator overrides"). Cause: `platformApiTimeoutMs` (schema.ts:565, default 10000; config/default.yaml:101) was added in `4089b51f` and the tests' expected objects were not updated. Pre-existing, unrelated to messaging, not touched by this item.
- **Type checks:** `npx tsc -p apps/api/tsconfig.json --noEmit` exit 0; `apps/worker` exit 0; `packages/db` exit 0.
- **Tier-2 decisions:** (1) Did not fix the 2 stale tests, because the acceptance says no code changed. They are recorded as known baseline failures. Fixing them is a one-line-per-test change for a later item or the owner. (2) Ticked C0: its acceptance is that `pnpm test` completes and counts are recorded, not that it is green. (3) The old 362/28 and 6816/6829 figures count differently from the current run (413 total files). They are marked superseded rather than reconciled.
- **Not committed.** Changes are left unstaged for the coordinator.

Next ready item: C1.
