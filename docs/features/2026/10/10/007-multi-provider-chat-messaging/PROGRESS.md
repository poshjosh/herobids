## 2026-10-25: authoring and verification

- **Authored** this entrypoint set, replacing the queue and rules in AGENT-ENTRYPOINT.md (now a pointer).
- **Verified P3.1 and P3.2 in code.** Route: `apps/api/src/routes/agent-interactivity.ts` (`POST` and `GET /messaging/chat/:provider/webhook`). Bypass: `apps/api/src/plugins/auth.ts`, pattern `^/messaging/chat/[a-z0-9-]+/webhook$`. Status set to done (DEC-14).
- **Verified the Telegram constant-time secret check.** `apps/api/src/routes/telegram-channel.ts` uses `timingSafeEqual`. `apps/api/src/routes/telegram-channel.test.ts`: 15 of 15 passed. Bug report 001 filed (FIXED). Defect origin `919f9ec7`, fix `d553c64e`.
- **Reviewed other secret and signature checks.** Stripe and Creem use a length-checked `timingSafeEqual`. No change needed.
- **Recorded** that W and E are implemented (W1 to W8, E1 to E7) with manual checks still open (W9, E8). Recorded in the 900 "W and E implementation status" section.
- **Found** that CH2W (002 two-way chat) is a draft with no code. A2A-B depends on it. Added as a blocked item.



## 2026-10-25: owner records W9 and E8 manual checks

- **W9 (M1 to M5)** and **E8 (M-E1 to M-E4)** were run by the owner on 2026-10-24 and reported passed. Recorded in [user-acceptance-tests §19](../../../../../tech/user-acceptance-tests.md). W and E are ticked in QUEUE.md (DEC-29).
- **Open:** M-E5 (SES bounce and complaint metrics after the first run). Owner.
- **Open:** EM-02 (email cap) and EM-03 (toggle default) are in the UAT file and not recorded.
- The agent did not re-run these checks.

Next ready item: C0.

## 2026-10-25: owner decisions recorded

- Recorded D01 to D09 as DEC-30 to DEC-39 in DECISIONS.md. The open list is closed.
- Queue rewritten: C2-R (independent review) and E-R1 (email rule) added. The two-way chat item (CH2W) now runs after C1.
- C1 spec: clarified that `agent_outbound_messages` keeps its delivery columns.
- C2 spec: `POST /agents/verify-telegram` is removed (DEC-34). No web caller exists. Confirmed by search.
- Plan 002: status updated and section 9 answers recorded (section 11).

Next ready item: C0.

## 2026-10-25: MVP scope change for agent-to-agent (DEC-40 to DEC-46)

- Owner decisions recorded in DECISIONS.md: same-user agents may message by default; the trading-tool risk is accepted for the MVP (DEC-41); one per-user rate limit of 10 per minute (DEC-42); owner view and a per-user stop switch (DEC-43); prompt-injection stance deferred (DEC-44).
- Deferred with specs kept: C2, C2-R, E-R1, U, the grant table and screen, A2A-C, A2A-D (DEC-45).
- A2A-A reduced to the same-user check. Its old grant spec file was removed and replaced by `A2A-A-same-user-check.md`.
- A2A-B rewritten as the MVP send path.
- Queue order: C0, C1, CH2W, A2A-A, A2A-B (DEC-46).
- Known gap accepted: chat address claims are unverified until C2 ships. Recorded for the owner.
- No code changed. No tests run.

Next ready item: C0.
